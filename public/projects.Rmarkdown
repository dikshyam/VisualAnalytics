#### **Teradata Data Challenge** 
> *Date: January, 2019*



#### **Text Analytics of Scientific literature into a causal network**
> *Date: October, 2018*

> A semi-automatic text extraction and grouping of theoretical constructs and variables  
(1)  Extracting performance indicators as DVs, (2) Grouping DVs by stakeholder group (and subcategories), (3) Identifying and extracting predictors, (4) Grouping predictors, (5) Linking all into a causal network using Visuals.

#### **Irony Detection in Twitter Data** 
>*Date: August, 2018*

> The task of the project was to build a supervised Machine learning model to detect irony in tweets. Designed an Ensemble Model using Classical Machine learning Algorithms and Neural Networks, accuracy of 75%

#### **Optimizing Human-Machine Task on Localization** 
>*Date: June, 2016*

> Participated and Collaborated on a computer vision project exploring the role of human computation under the guidance of Prof. James Davis at UC Santa Cruz. Technologies used were OpenCV in C++, HPU and CPU tools, GIT

#### **Trace Analyzer** 
> *Date: May, 2016*

> A Linux-based application tool for all NS2 users. Worked with the trace files of 4 ad-hoc routing protocols and comparing the performance of the protocols by using the generated data under the metric as per usersâ€™ instruction, whilst the protocols subjected to identical loads and environmental conditions and evaluate their relative performance and determining which is best for the given scenario and displaying results in GNU Plot
